Purpose:
This project is called TWTRP and uses GA and our own cross method to solve distribution problem in bike-sharing system

Solution:
We use many soft-computing solution try to solve this problem

How to use it:
1. User could simply use BikeSharingSystem.exe under BikeSaringDemo\BikeSharingSystem\bin\Debug to run the test
2. After program start, user could click open and load a benchmark under BenchMark folder to load Taipei/New Taipei/Kaoshung city ubkike data
3. After load benchmark, user could click Create GA Solver and set the parameters for Genetic Algorithm then click Reset 
   to let GA solver load these parameter setting. Finally, user could click run to see the solving result.


Maintain problem:
Since City government may change bike-sharing system json format on their database, it is possible that user cannot
use TWTRP Generation page to generate benchmark
